# Learning Python Basics with the Real World Examples
This Repository is meant for Learning Python Fundamentals with the real world examples.
It would invoke some thoughts and logic inside you to go further.

There would be lots of examples and exercises on the top of that that you can do to be comfortable with Python Programming.
Once you are good with basic concepts explained in this repository, you can go ahead and practice those exercises mentioned in exercise folder.
Real world examples are the examples which you would see around you in regular basis like conversion of json to csv, pdf to images, web scraping etc.


## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.x preferably > 3.7
2. Mostly pip would be installed with Python package, if not then install pip separately.
3. git is installed and you know basics of git commands.
4. Have access to terminal/command line
5. You know basic concepts of any programming language, not mandatory though

## Helpful Resources
### Books
### Articles/Blogs
### Videos (Youtube mainly)
### Online Courses (Free or Paid)

## ToDo List
- [] Add examples for all basic concepts
- [] Add at least 20 simple exercises similar to hackerrank or hackerearth 
- [] Add at least 20 common real-world examples
- [] Add 3-5 real-world examples for ML & DS, 
- [] Add 3-5 real-world examples for Web Development
- [] Add 3-5 real-world examples for AWS
- [] Add 3-5 real-world examples for CyberSecurity

## Troubleshoot
- You should be using Python 3.x preferably > 3.7
- Check python version `python --version`
- Similarly check pip version `pip --version`. It should point to Python3.x
- If you get module name not found error, try to install that named module as `pip install module-name`
- If you are getting any other error mail me. I would add those steps here.

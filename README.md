# Learning Python Basics with the Real World Examples
This Repository is meant for Learning Python Fundamentals with the real world examples.
It would invoke some thoughts and logic inside you to go further.

There would be lots of examples and exercises on the top of that that you can do to be comfortable with Python Programming.
Once you are good with basic concepts explained in this repository, you can go ahead and practice those exercises mentioned in exercise folder.
Real world examples are the examples which you would see around you in regular basis like conversion of json to csv, pdf to images, web scraping etc.

## Troubleshoot
- You should be using Python 3.x preferably > 3.7
- Check python version `python --version`
- Similarly check pip version `pip --version`. It should point to Python3.x
- If you get module name not found error, try to install that named module as `pip install module-name`
- If you are getting any other error mail me. I would add those steps here.
